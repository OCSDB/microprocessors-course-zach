Audruino Reflection

From very limited initial knowledge about microprocessors, we learned how to import software to the hardware (microprocessor)
and how to wire the processor so that an LED would flash on and off continuously. We also learnt how to incorporate 
a button to control the state of the LED and wrote code from scratch into the given code to debounce the button. We 
learnt that without the debouncing the button the LED, when pushing the button to change the state of the LED, the LED
would sometime revert to the previous state (as in the LED would switch states briefly change before reverting to the
state before the button was pushed). Although our debounce code we wrote works, we never fully comprehended why it worked
with a certain value and not others but none the less we completed the challenge. Through this experience we have gained a
much richer understanding of the relations between software and hardware.
